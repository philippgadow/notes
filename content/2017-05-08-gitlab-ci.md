## Adding Gitlab CI to your projects

### General Idea

Testing your code for several use cases is an annoying and redundant task.
We therefore suggest to make use of the industry-standard and excellent
continuous integration (CI) system, which is integrated in gitlab and activated
by default.

### How to enable automated code-checking

https://gitlab.cern.ch/gitlabci-examples/static_code_analysis

Introducing additional, automatic static code analysis inside your code repository is a very simple way to ensure that your code is clean from known security issues and bad practices.

It is especially efficient when working in groups or teams, because it allows you to focus more on your task, rather than on which tools everyone should use and how.

Since you do not need to prepare your testing environment for every change, you are saving time. You can free yourself from platform-dependent excuses - say good bye to phrases like "hmm, it was working on my desktop".

Long story short: because it is worth it!

Gitlab-CI has been a part of Gitlab, since version 8.0,
that allows one to easily introduce Continuous Integration. 
Continuous Integration means automating
periodic tasks, like building (for example - code compilation),
testing (running unit tests or some code analyzers)
and deploying (sending a ready package to the repository).

It is very simple to set up Continuous Integration in a repository
with Gitlab-CI. Just add a basic configuration file to your repository
called .gitlab-ci.yml. 

Note that some of the jobs will fail (or even more if our code is buggy - happy code cleaning!)

### How-to set up a docker production environment
We will now set up an automated Docker container build for a gitlab project - sounds exciting? If you don't know what Docker is, let me tell you this far:

Everytime a new feature is added to the project, you will get an app, which you can run on any computer or cloud service. You can optionally introduce tests before this step, but this is not the purpose of this tutorial snippet.



Create a new project for the purposes of this test.
```
mkdir testCIdocker
cd testCIdocker
git init
```

Create a new file with name `helloworld.sh`
and paste as its content

```
#!/bin/bash
echo HelloWorld script within Docker image \n
exit 0
```

This is already this program.

Now create the Dockerfile which will specify how the container will be built. Create a `Dockerfile` and paste as its contents

```
FROM cern/cc7-base

MAINTAINER paul.philipp.gadow@cern.ch

COPY helloworld.sh /
RUN chmod 700 /helloworld.sh

ENTRYPOINT /helloworld.sh
```

Now comes the most important part, the file steering gitlabs very own production system. Gitlab uses yaml (yet another markup language, a fancy version of an ini file) to tell its system what to do when somebody introduces a change to the project.

Create a file named `.gitlab-ci.yml` and paste to its content

```
build:
  stage: build
  tags:
    - docker-image-build
  script: "echo" # unused but this line is required by GitLab CI
```

Now add all files to your project and commit.
```
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
```

Create a new project on gitlab.cern.ch and name it testCIdocker.
Then follow the instructions to push the existing repository to gitlab.

You should receive an e-mail with the message that your pipeline was successfully run and that your project passed.

Well done! Now a snapshot of your directory exists

On your local machine, [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#supported-platforms) if you have not already done so.

In your gitlab project you should see the tab **Registry** directly next to the tabs **Project** and **Repository**. Follow these instructions there to run your first own project's docker container.

```
docker login gitlab-registry.cern.ch
```

Log in with your CERN credentials.

Now you can run the container with
```
docker run -t gitlab-registry.cern.ch/${USER}/testcidockerbuild
```

That is it! You have just automatically created a docker container of your project. You can use this container everywhere, for example also on CERN openstack or Amazon EC2. Have fun!
